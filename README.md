========

Modified firmware for [MMR-70 FM Music Transmitter](http://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/140251/MMR70.pdf).

Includes tree different projects:

1. [RADIO](https://github.com/achilikin/mmr70mod/blob/master/radio) - Similar to [FMBerry](https://github.com/Manawyrm/FMBerry), but running on MMR-70's ATmega32 itself instead of Raspberry Pi. Pure C + avr-gcc is used (not Arduino).
2. [BASE](https://github.com/achilikin/mmr70mod/blob/master/base) - Base Station for data acquisition network
3. [NODE](https://github.com/achilikin/mmr70mod/blob/master/node) - Data Node for data acquisition network
